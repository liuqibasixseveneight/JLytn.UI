# Application Stack Overview

Track the core runtime and tooling dependencies powering the app and apply the tips below when upgrading or adding features.

## Runtime Dependencies

1. `react@19.2.0` and `react-dom@19.2.0`
   - Lean on the new `use` hook and transition APIs only after confirming they are stable in your bundler pipeline.
   - Stick to functional components; React 19 drops implicit support for legacy patterns.
   - When mixing Suspense with data fetching, wrap boundary fallbacks with error handling since React 19 surfaces async errors synchronously.
2. `styled-components@6.1.19`
   - Prefer the `styled` API with typed `DefaultTheme`; keep `styled.d.ts` in sync with theme exports.
   - Use `StyleSheetManager` for SSR hydration if server-rendering is added later.
   - Avoid dynamic style strings inside render loops; memoize heavy interpolations.
3. `zustand@5.0.8`
   - Favor slices over monolithic stores; TypeScript generics in v5 help infer selectors.
   - Use the `subscribeWithSelector` middleware to reduce rerenders for derived state.
   - Persist stores with the built-in `persist` middleware; namespace keys to prevent collisions.
4. `gsap@3.13.0` and `@gsap/react@2.1.2`
   - Register plugins once at module scope; double registration throws in React strict mode.
   - Use the `useGSAP` hook for timeline lifecycles; always clean up to avoid stale animations.
   - Keep animation state outside React state unless UI needs the values; GSAP timelines manage their own state efficiently.

## Tooling

1. `vite@7.2.2`
   - Use the config’s `resolve.alias` for clean import paths; keep aliases mirrored in `tsconfig.json`.
   - Enable `optimizeDeps.include` for large third-party packages if cold-starts spike.
   - Keep `vite.config.ts` free of CommonJS plugins; Vite 7 expects pure ESM.
2. `typescript@5.9.3`
   - Activate `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` and `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` for safer patterns (supported in 5.9).
   - Use the new `using` declarations cautiously; ensure emitted cleanup works with React event loops.
   - Regenerate declarations when updating `styled-components` themes to prevent stale types.
3. `eslint@9.39.1` with `@eslint/js`, `typescript-eslint@8.46.3`, `eslint-plugin-react-hooks@5.2.0`, `eslint-plugin-react-refresh@0.4.24`
   - Run `eslint --cache` locally; ESLint 9’s flat config expects `eslint.config.js`—avoid mixing with legacy `.eslintrc`.
   - React 19 strictness pairs with the hooks plugin; keep dependency arrays exact to avoid double-invocation bugs.
   - React Refresh lint warnings indicate hot-reload mismatches—fix immediately to preserve fast refresh.

## Upgrade Checklist

1. Review release notes for React and Vite in tandem; breaking changes often require config tweaks.
2. Re-run unit and animation smoke tests after bumping GSAP; timeline internals can change subtly.
3. Update Cursor rules whenever the dependency stack shifts so automation stays trustworthy.
