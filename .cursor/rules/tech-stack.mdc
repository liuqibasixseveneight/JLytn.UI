# Tech Stack

Stay aligned with these dependency versions and best practices when building features or planning upgrades.

## Runtime

1. `react@19.2.0` and `react-dom@19.2.0`
   - Stick to functional components and the hooks API; legacy class patterns are no longer a focus in React 19.
   - Use the `use` hook, transitions, and suspense carefully—gate risky patterns behind feature flags until validated in Vite builds.
   - Wrap suspense boundaries with error boundaries; React 19 surfaces async errors more aggressively.
2. `styled-components@6.1.19`
   - Ensure `DefaultTheme` matches `components/theme/theme.ts` for type safety; update `src/types/styled.d.ts` alongside theme changes.
   - Prefer component-level styles over global CSS; encapsulate layout concerns inside `App.styles.ts`.
   - Memoize expensive interpolations or move them outside render scope to avoid needless re-renders.
3. `zustand@5.0.8`
   - Compose stores from small slices for clarity; export selectors to avoid broad subscriptions.
   - Combine with the `persist` middleware when state must survive reloads and namespace keys to avoid collisions.
   - Use `subscribeWithSelector` or `shallow` comparison helpers to minimize rerenders.
4. `gsap@3.13.0` and `@gsap/react@2.1.2`
   - Register GSAP plugins once at module scope; duplicate registrations throw in strict mode.
   - Manage timelines with `useGSAP`; return cleanup functions to tear down animations on unmount.
   - Keep animation state in GSAP timelines unless UI needs to render it; avoids React render loops.

## Tooling

1. `vite@7.2.2`
   - Keep `vite.config.ts` ESM-only; avoid CommonJS plugins.
   - Use `resolve.alias` to standardize import paths and mirror aliases inside `tsconfig.json`.
   - Profile cold starts; add packages to `optimizeDeps.include` if builds slow down.
2. `typescript@5.9.3`
   - Enable stricter flags like `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` and `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` to catch common bugs.
   - Leverage new `using` declarations judiciously—confirm emitted cleanup aligns with React lifecycles.
   - Regenerate declaration files whenever theme typing changes to keep styled-components IntelliSense accurate.
3. `eslint@9.39.1`, `@eslint/js@9.39.1`, `typescript-eslint@8.46.3`, `eslint-plugin-react-hooks@5.2.0`, `eslint-plugin-react-refresh@0.4.24`
   - Use flat config (`eslint.config.js`); do not mix with legacy `.eslintrc`.
   - Keep hook dependency arrays exact to appease strict double-invoke behavior in React 19.
   - Resolve React Refresh lint warnings quickly—they indicate HMR-safety issues.

## Maintenance Checklist

1. Review React and Vite release notes together before upgrades; bundler tweaks often follow React changes.
2. Re-run animation smoke tests after GSAP bumps—timeline behavior can shift between minor versions.
3. Update this rule whenever dependency versions change so Cursor guidance remains authoritative.
